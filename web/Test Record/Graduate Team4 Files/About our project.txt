I run our group application using mysql 5.0 and tomcat 6.0.
To change database access user name and password, please go to SQLAccess.java file in dbmanager folder, finding the lines:

private static String connectStr = "jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/alertsystem";
private static String userName = "root";
private static String passWord = "1234";

make changes to new database name, username, and password, etc.
